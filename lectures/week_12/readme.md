#### Decision Tree Learning

What is learning? \
We are given data $x \in \R^D$ (x is a datapoint is a in a D dimensional space) and from this we want to learn about output $y$ typically a label... \
$f:x \rarr y$ \
$f$ is a linear function or a quadratic function or smthng that we define... \
In the current scenarion we model $f$ as a Neural Network... \
This is referred as supervised learning... \
A category of supervised learning is Decision Tree structure...

Decision Tree Structure... \
Learning CLassification Tree... \
Entropy(I) represents the expected number of bits to encode the class (+ or -) of a randomly drawn member of I
